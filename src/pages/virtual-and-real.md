What differences do I notice between meeting in a virtual way and meeting in a real way?<!-- end -->

### Eye contact

Today, while delivering a remote training using Google Meet, I came to realize a strong difference between real meetings and virtual ones, with respect to eye contact.

When using such an application with several people, you don't know who the speaker is looking at because you can't figure out which thumbnail he/she is actually watching. You can only make assumptions.

When meeting face to face, the gaze direction is obvious because the face is pointing towards you.
