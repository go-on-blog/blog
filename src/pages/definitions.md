Reference definitions of software engineering terms. The definitions either come from standards bodies or from people who are authorities in their field.<!-- end -->

### Acceptance Criteria

> 1. Criteria that a system or component must satisfy in order to be accepted
> by a user, customer, or other authorized entity;
> 2. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted.
> 1. the criteria that a system or component must satisfy in order to be accepted by a user, customer, or other authorized entity. 2. those criteria, including performance requirements and essential conditions, which must be met before project deliverables are accepted.

### ATDD

> Form of test-[first] development that concentrates on applying TDD at the feature [...] level, based on acceptance tests developed for requirements at those levels.
>
> [AAMI TIR45, section 3.2][TIR45]

### Cognitive bias

> A systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.
>
> Martie Haselton, Daniel Nettle, Paul W. Andrews (2005). « The evolution of cognitive bias ». In [The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology](http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/handbookevpsych.pdf). John Wiley & Sons Inc. pp. 724–746.

### Command and Control (C2)

> The term command and control is clearly a product of the Industrial Age.
> The first use of the term as we understand it appears to be by Jomini
> (Henri de Jomini, 1838) in The Art of War, when he entitles a section of
> the book, “The Command of Armies and the Supreme Control of Operations.”
> [...]
> 
> Many official definitions continue to be focused on the authorities associated with command, not on what needs to be accomplished and how it could or should be accomplished [...].
> 
> It was not until the middle of the century, following Napoleon’s staff innovations, that the term command and control began to be widely used. This raised the question of what the additional term control meant. Several explanations have been provided. **One view maintains that command refers to what a commander does and control is associated with how the “will” of the commander becomes translated into instructions** and promulgated throughout forces by the command staff [...]. **Another view parses “the art and science of command and control”: command is the art, and control is the science** [...]. The control (or scientific) aspect of C2 fit well into an Industrial Age perspective that assumed that organizations and situations could be adequately represented as machines, albeit complicated machines. Given that a machine behaves according to a knowable set of rules, results could be controlled scientifically.

### Continuous Delivery

> Continuous Delivery is a set of capabilities that enable us to get changes of all kinds — features, configuration changes, bug fixes, experiments — into production or into the hands of users *safely*, *quickly*, and *sustainably*.
> 
> Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, Gene Kim. Accelerate. 2018.

### Design input

> [...] the physical and performance requirements of a device that are used as a basis for device design.
>
> [US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, 820.3(f) Definitions][QSR]

### Design output

> [...] the results of a design effort at each design phase and at the end of the total design effort. The finished design output is the basis for the device master record. The total finished design output consists of the device, its packaging and labeling, and the device master record. 
>
> [US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, 820.3(g) Definitions][QSR]

### Feature Team

> A feature team is a long-lived, cross-functional, cross-component team that completes many end-to-end customer features — one by one.
>
> Craig Larman, Bas Vodde in [Scaling Lean & Agile Development](https://res.infoq.com/articles/scaling-lean-agile-feature-teams/en/resources/feature%20teams_%20infoq_%20final.pdf)

### Should, May, Can, Must

> [...] *should* indicates that among several possibilities, one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action should be avoided but is not prohibited.
> 
> *May* is used to indicate that a course of action is permissible within the limits of the recommended practice.
> 
> *Can* is used as a statement of possibility and capability. 
> 
> Finally, *must* is used only to describe “unavoidable” situations, including those mandated by government regulation.
>
> [AAMI TIR45, Foreword][TIR45]

### Managing

> *Managing* is dealing with uncertainty.

> 
> [Débunkage & entretien épistémique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99InBSdGjO0)

> Reactance occurs when a person feels that someone or something is taking away their choices or limiting the range of alternatives.
> 
> [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)) (accessed December 3rd 2020).

### Refactoring

> *Refactoring* is lots of small changes, none of which change 
> the observable part of the software.
> 
> Fowler, Martin. [The State of Agile Software in 2018](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html).

### Requirement

> A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system, product, service, result, or component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document. Requirements include the quantified and documented needs, wants, and expectations of the sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders.
> 
> [A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge - Fourth Edition][PMBOK]

<!-- 
  Condition ou capacité que doit présenter un système pour satisfaire un contrat, un standard, une spécification ou tout autre document formel imposé.
 -->

> **Design inputs** are the *interpretation of customer needs* into formally documented MEDICAL DEVICE requirements. 
> 
> **Software requirements** are the formally documented specifications of *what the software does to meet the customer needs* and the design inputs. 
> 
> **Software functional specifications** are often included with the software requirements and *define in detail what the software does to meet its requirements* even though many different alternatives might also meet the requirements. 
> 
> **Software design specifications** define *how the software will be designed* and decomposed to implement its requirements and functional specifications.
> 
> [B.5.2 Software requirements analysis][IEC62304]

### Software Item

> Three terms identify the software decomposition. The top level is the SOFTWARE SYSTEM. The lowest level that is not further decomposed is the SOFTWARE UNIT. All levels of composition, including the top and bottom levels, can be called SOFTWARE ITEMS. A SOFTWARE SYSTEM, then, is composed of one or more SOFTWARE ITEMS, and each SOFTWARE ITEM is composed of one or more SOFTWARE UNITS or decomposable SOFTWARE ITEMS. The responsibility is left to the MANUFACTURER to provide the definition and granularity of the SOFTWARE ITEMS and SOFTWARE UNITS.
> 
> [3.25 SOFTWARE ITEM][IEC62304]

### Specification

> Specification means any requirement with which a product, process, service, or other activity must conform.
> [820.3 Definitions.][QSR]

> A document that specifies, in a complete, precise, verifiable manner, the requirements, design, behavior, or other characteristics of a system, component, product, result, or service and, often, the procedures for determining whether these provisions have been satisfied.
> 
> [A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge — Fourth Edition][PMBOK]

### Specification By Example

The term [Specification By Example](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SpecificationByExample.html) was originally coined by Martin Fowler in 2004.

It is also a [book](https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/) published by Gojko Adzic in 2011.

### Spike

> Prove to team it’s possible. Timebox effort.
> 
> Zach Bonaker. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zachbonaker/status/1207042495990751232)
> 
>> Spike should never have the potential to evolve into the final product.
>> 
>> Alistair Cockburn. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TotherAlistair/status/1207303748491644928)

### Stakeholder

> Anyone who could stop a product from going live is a stakeholder.
> 
> Arie van Bennekum. Agile Coach Academy, September 2020.

### Three amigos

> I suggest you read George Dinwiddie’s [blog on the 3 amigos](http://blog.gdinwiddie.com/tag/three-amigos/). He is the originator of this term.

### Unit Test

> A test written by a programmer for the purpose of ensuring
> that the production code does what the programmer expects it to do.
>
> [First-Class Tests, Robert C. Martin](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/05/05/TestDefinitions.html)

### User Story

> [...] description of a change in system behavior from the perspective of a user.
>
> [The Humanizing Work Guide to Splitting User Stories](https://www.humanizingwork.com/the-humanizing-work-guide-to-splitting-user-stories/). (Accessed on December 13th, 2020.)

> User Stories originate with Extreme Programming, their first written description in 1998 only claims that customers define project scope “with user stories, which are like use cases”. Rather than offered as a distinct practice, they are described as one of the “game pieces” used in the “planning game”.
> 
> [User Stories, Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-stories/)

### User Story Template 

> The “role-feature-reason” format for expressing user stories was invented at Connextra in the UK in 2001.
> 
> [User Story Template, Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/user-story-template/)

### Validation

> Confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that software specifications conform to user needs and intended uses, and that the particular requirements implemented through software can be consistently fulfilled.
> 
> [General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff](https://www.fda.gov/media/73141/download). 2002.

### Velocity <a name="velocity"></a>

> Velocity is the sum of the estimates of delivered (i.e., accepted) features per iteration.
> 
> [Measuring the Velocity of your Agile Scrum Team](https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/agile-scrum-velocity)

### Verification

> Confirmation through provision of objective evidence that specified requirements have been fulfilled.
> 
> [General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance forIndustry and FDA Staff](https://www.fda.gov/media/73141/download). 2002.
