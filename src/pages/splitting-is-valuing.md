Teams often find it hard to split large backlog items into smaller ones. And it is even more difficult to split items while preserving value. So itâ€™s important to make clear that splitting has an impact on value.<!-- end -->

### Start with with a mesh of triangles

![Mesh of triangles](../images/gerrymandering-1.png)

### Equal number of blue and red triangles

Color triangles so that you have 10 blue triangles and 10 red triangles.

### Equal regions

Draw boundaries so that you get 4 regions of 5 triangles.
Two of them should include a majority (3) of blue triangles.
Two of them should include a majority (3) of red triangles.

### Unequal regions

Remove the previous boundaries. Then ask the participants to draw boundaries so that they still get 4 regions of 5 triangles but with more regions with a majority of red triangles than regions with a majority of blue triangles.

### One possible solution

### Conclusion

Even if you have an equal distribution of red and blue triangles, you may find boundaries that will change the *value* of the regions (who has the majority).

This is what we call gerrymandering.
